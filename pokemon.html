<h1>Pokémon</h1>
<p>Pokémon[a] is a Japanese media franchise encompassing video games,
<br> animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media.The
<br>franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist with creatures
<br>known as Pokémon, which are primarily caught and raised by Pokémon Trainers to
<br>battle each other for sport. The franchise's target audience is children aged 5 to 12,[1]
<br>but it has garnered fans of all ages.[2][3][4][5] <p>

<p>The concept behind the franchise was originated by Satoshi Tajiri. The first games in 
<br>the franchise, Pocket Monsters Red and Pocket Monsters Green, were released for 
<br>the Game Boy in Japan in February 1996. The games became sleeper hits, and were
<br>released internationally as Pokémon Red and Blue beginning in 1998. The international
<br>release of Red and Blue marked the beginning of an unprecedented global
<br>phenomenon that lasted from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, known as 
<br>"Pokémania". Pokémon has since been estimated to be the world's highest-grossing
<br>media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.</p>

<p>Pokémon has an uncommon ownership structure. While most IPs are owned by a single
<br>company, Pokémon is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak,
<br>and Creatures.[6][7] Game Freak develops the core series role-playing games, which are
<br>published by Nintendo exclusively for their consoles, while Creatures manages the 
<br>trading card game and related merchandise, occasionally developing spin-off titles. The
<br>three companies established The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the
<br>Pokémon property within Asia. The Pokémon anime series and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. 
<br>Since 2009, The Pokémon Company International (TPCi) subsidiary of TPC has managed the franchise
<br>in all regions outside of Asia.[8]by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pokémon Company International 
<br>(TPCi) subsidiary of TPC has managed the franchise in all regions outside of Asia.[8]</p>

<h1>Name</h1>

<p>The contracted term Pokémon derives from a syllabic abbreviation of the franchise's full name,
<br>Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā). When the franchise began to be released internationally,
<br>the short form of the title was used, with an acute accent (´) for pronunciation.[9]
<br>Pokémon refers both to the franchise itself and the creatures within its fictional universe. As a noun,
<br>it is identical in both the singular and plural, as is every individual species name;[10] it is grammatically
<br>correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu". In English, 
<br>Pokémon may be pronounced either /'powkɛmon/ (poe-keh-mon) or /'powkɪmon/ (poe-key-mon).[11]</p>

<h3>Main articles: Pokémon universe and Gameplay of Pokémon</h3>
<p>The Pokémon franchise is set in a world in which humans coexist with creatures known as Pokémon. Pokémon 
<br>Red and Blue introduced 151 Pokémon species, with new Pokémon being introduced in subsequent games; as 
<br>of February 2023, 1,015 Pokémon species have been introduced.[b] Many Pokémon are designed to resemble
<br> real-world animals; for example, Pikachu is a yellow mouse-like Pokémon with a lightning bolt-shaped tail,
<br> and possesses electrical abilities.</p>

<p>The player character takes the role of a Pokémon Trainer. The Trainer's three primary goals are to explore the
<br> Pokémon world, complete their Pokédex―an electronic handheld encyclopedia―by obtaining all available Pokémon,
<br> and to train a team of up to six Pokémon at a time and engage them in battle. To obtain most Pokémon, the Trainer
<br> uses a spherical device known as a Poké Ball. Once the opposing Pokémon is sufficiently weakened, the Trainer throws
<br> the Poké Ball against it, and it is then transformed into a form of energy to be transported into the device. Once
<br> the Pokémon is successfully caught, it is under the Trainer's command from then on. If the Poké Ball is thrown again,
<br> the Pokémon re-materializes into its original state. The Trainer's Pokémon can engage in battles against opposing
<br> Pokémon, including those in the wild or owned by other Trainers. Because the franchise is aimed at children, these
<br> battles are never presented as overtly violent and contain no blood or gore.[12][13][14][15] Pokémon never die in battle, 
<br>instead fainting upon being defeated.[16][17][18]</p>

<p>After a Pokémon wins a battle, it gains experience and becomes stronger. After gaining a certain amount of experience
<br> points, its level increases, as well as one or more of its statistics. As its level increases, the Pokémon can 
<br>learn new offensive and defensive moves to use in battle. Many species of Pokémon can evolve into a different species,
<br> with increased stats compared to its pre-evolved form. Most species will evolve at a certain level, while others 
<br>evolve through different means, such as exposure to an evolution stone.</p>

<h1>History</h1>

<h3>For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Pokémon.
Origins</h3>

<p>The concept behind Pokemon was originated by Satoshi Tajiri. Tajiri grew up in Machida, a suburb of
<br>Tokyo; and in his youth, enjoyed discovering and catching insects and other small creatures in the various 
<br>ponds and fields that surrounded his town.[19][20] As Japan's economic miracle began, many cities, including
<br>Machida, were significantly expanded, consequently encroaching the nature of the town. In his second year
<br>of junior high school,[21][22] an arcade hall opened in Tajiri's neighborhood, and he developed an interest
<br>in video games. While studying electrical engineering at Tokyo College of Technology [ja], Tajiri began publishing 
<br>a doujinshi magazine titled Game Freak.[23] The title was inspired by the 1932 film Freaks, of which Tajiri was a fan.
<br>[24] He self-published the first issue of the magazine in March 1983, at the age of 17.[25] [26] At the time, video
<br>game magazines were not yet published in Japan, allowing Game Freak to fill a gap in the market.[27][28] Concurrently,
<br>Tajiri was contacted by aspiring manga artist Ken Sugimori, who became Game Freak's illustrator.[29] Game Freak folded
<br>in the late 1980s,[25] by which point Tajiri had become a respected game journalist in Japan's fledgling video game 
<br>industry.[30]</p>

<p>Tajiri's knowledge of video games brought him into contact with Tsunekazu Ishihara. Ishihara had studied Arts and
<br> Science at Tsukuba University, and was trained in CGI. After working in advertisement for two years, Ishihara joined
 <br>a company named Sedic in 1983, which created video graphics and software,[31] including one video game, Otocky (1987)
.<br>[32][33] As video games became popular, Sedic also produced a number of game-related television shows for Fuji Television
<br>'s late-night slot.[31] Ishihara, who became a TV producer, befriended Tajiri, as well as ShigesatoItoi, who would later 
<br>become CEO of Ape, Inc.[34][35] Ishihara was also the general director of the world's first gaming encyclopedia, TV Games: 
<br>Encyclopedia of Video Games (テレビゲーム―電視遊戯大全, Terebigēmu ― Denshi Yūgi Taizen).[36][37] In 2000, Kenji Hatakeyama &
<br>Masakazu Kubo wrote that, at the time, Ishihara was probably the most well-connected man in the industry,[38] with a 
<br>knowledge of games "beyond comparison".[39] Ishihara was also interested in playing cards,[40][41] and contributed to 
<br>the development of at least three simple card games designed by Itoi for Ape.[c]</p>

<p>In 1986, Tajiri, Sugimori, and a small group of fellow enthusiasts started an informal development team, named Game
<br>Freak, after the Tajiri's magazine. During the next three years, they independently developed the puzzle game Quinty,
<br>working on it alongside school or their other jobs.[48] However, no one within the group could compose its music.
<br>After consulting all his contacts, Tajiri came into contact with Junichi Masuda, who became the group's composer.
<br>[49] Quinty was finished in 1989, and published by Namco.[50] Tajiri officially incorporated Game Freak Co., Ltd. 
<br>on April 26, 1989.[51]1989 – 1995: Development of Red & Green</p>

<h3>Further information: Pokémon Red and Blue § Development</h3>
<h3>Two Game Boy consoles connected with a Game Link Cable.</h3>

<p>Tajiri began developing ideas for Pokemon as development on Quinty neared its end. During this period, Nintendo 
<br>announced the handheld Game Boy console. Tajiri learned that the device would have a link port, and with the corresponding
<br>Game Link Cable, two Game Boy unites could be connected.[52] Tajiri also remembered an incident while playing Dragon 
<br>Quest II, in which in-game items of varying rarities randomly appeared, including the rare Mysterious Hat.[d] Tajiri did
<br>not encounter any, while Sugimori, who was also playing the game, encountered two. Upon recalling this experience, Tajiri
<br>realized that the cable now made it possible to transfer data from one cartridge to another.[53][54][55][56] Until that
<br>point, the Game Link Cable was only used for competing.[57] Combining his inspiration with his childhood memories, Tajiri
<br>developed his idea into a virtual recreation of these experiences,[58] and an attempt to "regain the world that he had
<br>lost".[59] He would later state that the game represents "the story of a boy's summer day".[60]Gashapon capsules have
<br>been cited as an inspiration for Pokemon.</p>

<p>Tajiri and his staff began developing a game centered on capturing creatures of differing rarity. Because the Game Boy
<br>is a handheld console, these creatures could be exchanged with other players in real life. Once the player caught one of
<br>these creatures, it was to be stored in miniaturized form in a special capsule. This facet of the game was inspired by
<br>Ultraseven, a tokusatsu show that Tajiri had enjoyed as a child.[61] The series' titular character owns a number of capsules
<br>containing miniaturized kaiju, which come out and return to their original sizes when the capsule is thrown into mid-air.
<br>Kaiju media were an important influence to the developers, as many Game Freak staff members grew up with them.[54][62]
<br>Other cited influences include gashapon, capsules with toy figures in them that can be drawn from vending machines;[63][64]
<br>collectible cards, such as baseball cards, Ultraman cards and menko;[65][66][67][68] The Final Fantasy Legend;[69] and petting 
<br>in Japan, with Tajiri noting that having Pokemon is similar to having pets.[70] Tajiri initially named his project Capsule 
<br>Monsters, which GF's staff commonly shortened to Capumon.[71] However, Capsule Monsters could not be trademarked, and it was
<br>subsequently decided to title the game Pocket Monsters, which was shortened to Pokemon.[71][72] Author Akihito Tomisawa
<br>wrote that the Game Freak staff devised with several alternatives, before settling on "Pocket Monsters".[71]</p>

<p>In March 1989, Nintendo co-founded Ape, Inc. with Itoi. Ape's principal work was Mother (1989), a role-playing game written by 
<br>Itoi, but it was also founded with the intent to give outside talent a chance to pitch new, innovative games.[40][35] At the time,
<br>Ape was housed in the same Kanda-Sudachō office building as Nintendo, located in Tokyo.[73] Ishihara, a friend of both Itoi and 
<br>Tajiri, was involved with Ape's management and became vice president of the company in 1991.[35][38] Tajiri's relationship with Ishihara
<br>prompted the former to present his pitch at Ape's office.[74][75] Present during Tajiri's pitch was Takashi Kawaguchi, who worked at
<br>Nintendo's General Affairs Department and was also a manager at Ape.[40][76] Kawaguchi brought the idea to Nintendo president Hiroshi
<br>Yamauchi, who reportedly said, "This is it. This is the idea I've been waiting for."[77] Coincidentally, Ishihara had conceived an idea
<br>for a game similar to that of Tajiri, and was also discussing it with Ape. The planned title, Toto, involved "using the Game Boy as an 
<br>insect cage". Game Freak and Ape subsequently agreed to develop their projects as one.[78] According to Tajiri, the two teams initially
<br>collaborated on the project, but the work proved difficult, one of the reasons being that Ape was busy developing EarthBound.[79][80] Tajiri 
<br>eventually figured that "rather than working with Ape, we had to do something on our own, or the project would never get finished".[79] Ape,
<br>Inc. was subsequently not credited on the final product.</p>

<p>The development contract was signed at the beginning of 1990, with a planned delivery of the game in October.[81] Tajiri directed the project,<br>working under Ishihara.[82] Ishihara was the producer – he managed the budget, staff, and work schedule, monitored the game's overall progress, and <br>served as a liaison between Game Freak and Nintendo.[83][78] Ishihara also contributed ideas to the development,[41] and helped with debugging.[84][85]<br>Sugimori was in charge of the graphics and character design.[86] Masuda composed the score and sound effects, and did additional programming.[87] <br>The budget that Nintendo granted to Game Freak was low.[81] Thus, Pocket Monsters was initially planned as a small, compact game, based primarily around<br>Tajiri's core idea of exchanging.[69][88] However, as development progressed, GF's ideas and ambitions for the game grew.[69] It became clear that their<br>idea would not be easy to realize. Sugimori admitted that, at the time, no one on the staff had much knowledge of RPGs.[89] The project was consequently <br>suspended indefinitely. While developing their second game, Smart Ball (1991), Game Freak was commissioned by Nintendo to develop Yoshi (1991),<br>a simple puzzle game, the idea for which was suggested by Ishihara.[90] Yoshi sold over three million copies worldwide,[91] and both Tajiri[92] and Masuda <br>[41] said that this success allowed Game Freak to survive. Over the next three years, GF developed four more games: Magical Tarurūto-kun (1992), Mario &<br>Wario (1993), Nontan to Issho: KuruKuru Puzzle, and Pulseman (both 1994).</p>

<p>It is commonly stated that development for the initial game took six years.[10][93][94][95][96] This is, in fact, the total time passed from<br>planning to finish—the game did not take six straight years to complete.[97] After the initial development phase in the early 1990s,[98] the<br>staff "tinkered with it from time to time", as Sugimori put it.[99] By October 1992, many Pokemon had already been designed, and a poll was held<br>that month among all staff members to gauge the popularity of the different species. Several more such votes followed to determine collectively which<br>Pokemon should be included.[100] Still, development was largely suspended until the summer of 1994, after the release of Pulseman, upon which Tajiri<br>decided it was time to make a serious effort towards finishing the game.[101] By this point, Game Freak's experience had grown considerably, and many <br>new staff members had joined the company, one of these being Atsuko Nishida, a graphic designer who created Pikachu, among others.[102][103][104] <br>Ishihara used his knowledge of card games to add more depth to the battle system and suggested that the creatures should have types. Ishihara also<br>came up with the idea of the Pokédex, a portable encyclopedia which players can use to keep track of their Pokemon.[41] Throughout the years, Tajiri<br>had several conversations with Shigeru Miyamoto,[105] Nintendo's senior game designer who Tajiri described as a mentor figure.[61] However, in a 2018<br>retrospect, Miyamoto downplayed his role, and stated that his contributions to Pocket Monsters were limited.[106]</p>

<p>Both Tajiri and Ishihara sought to 'individualize' the player's experience, to make each game slightly different so as to create a unique experience.<br>[107] At an early stage, Tajiri had the idea of having the software generate a random number on the first playthrough, ranging from 00001 to 65535 (the<br>highest possible value of an unsigned 16-bit integer).[108][109] When a player catches a Pokemon, it is assigned the game's ID and the player's name, <br>which are retained after it is traded.[110] Based on the unique ID, Game Freak intended for the game to render slightly different landscapes and present the<br>player with different Pokemon,[96][109][111] which ultimately proved impossible.[e] When Tajiri discussed these with Miyamoto, the latter opined that it was<br>slightly difficult to understand. Miyamoto also suggested using different colored cartridges, which would make the differences between versions more visually<br>clear.[112] According to Tajiri, "five or seven colors" were considered[113] before they settled on two: a Red version and a Green version. Both games were<br>identical, but each had Pokemon not found in the other, so as to encourage trading between players.[107]</p>

<p>Ishihara aspired to create games of his own.[114] As Pocket Monsters Red and Green were nearing completion, Ishihara founded Creatures,Inc. on November 8, 1995,<br>originally headquartered in the same Sudachō office building as the Nintendo Kanda Building in Tokyo.[115] Co-ownership of the Pocket Monsters property was subsequently<br>assigned to Creatures. This resulted in the intellectual property having three legal owners: Game Freak, the main developer; Creatures, representing producer Ishihara;<br>and Nintendo, the publisher, which acquired the property upon completion.[116] Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000) wrote that Pocket Monsters is probably the only property in<br>the world today for which the original rights are not concentrated in a single company."[117] Tajiri and Ishihara briefly considered merging Game Freak and Creatures,<br>before Tajiri decided against it, believing that it would erase what he had built up since he was a teenager. "I felt threatened by the idea of changing how Game <br>Freak was operating, and starting back over with Mr. Ishihara", he said. "It was an identity problem. If Game Freak ceased to exist, then so would I". Tajiri noted that,<br>since Game Freak and Creatures both focus on Pocket Monsters, it sometimes felt more like different departments than different companies.[74]</p>

<p>Development on Pocket Monsters Red and Pocket Monsters Green was completed in December 1995.[118] They were originally announced to release on December<br>21, 1995,[119] before being delayed to February 27, 1996 after a sufficient amount of cartridges, manuals, and packaging was produced. Copyright notices[6]<br>on merchandise display 1995 as the copyright date, despite no Pokemon product having actually been released that year.</p>

<h3><u>1996 – 1998: Rise in Japan</u></h3>
<h3><u>Release of Red & Green</u></h3>

<p>Nintendo had low expectations of Pocket Monsters Red and Green, and media largely ignored the games.[120] The Game Boy console was in production for seven years <br>at this point and was nearing the end of its lifecycle.[93][121][122][123]. However, the console was widespread and readily affordable to children,[124] and had experienced <br>a small amount of renewed interest due to the success of Mario's Picross. Coincidentally, this game directed by Isihara and co-developed by Ape. The popularity of Mario's<br>Picross inspired Nintendo to develop the Game Boy Pocket,[125] a slimmer and improved version of the Game Boy, released in Japan in July 1996.[126] Due to the timing of <br>the products, some believed that the Game Boy Pocket was created to promote Pocket Monsters, while others noted that it was purely coincidental timing that nonetheless 
<br>benefitted them both.[127]</p>

<h3><u>CoroCoro manga and promotions</u></h3>

<p>The monthly CoroCoro Comic and bimonthly BessatsuCoroCoro Comic magazines are published by Shogakukan, 
<br>a long-term business partner of Nintendo, and have featured manga based on Nintendo properties. The magazines 
<br>have long played a part in the franchise's popularity. At the time of Red and Green's release, CoroCoro Comic was read by
<br>one in four elementary school students.[128] CoroCoro's deputy editor-in-chief was Masakazu Kubo [ja]. On Ishihara's suggestion,[129] Kubo
<br>commissioned the creation of a manga series titled Pokemon Pocket Monsters, written and illustrated by Kosaku Anakubo
<br>[ja]; its first chapter was published in the March/April issue of BessatsuCoroCoro Comic, released on February 28, 
<br>1996, one day after the release of Red and Green.[130] In a survey of their target groups, Shogakukan determined that the Pocket
<br>Monsters manga was well received.[131]</p>

<p>As a tie-in, the May 1996 issue of CoroCoro announced the "Legendary Pokemon Offer", centered around the secret Pokemon,
<br>Mew.[132][133] Mew was a last-minute addition to Red & Green, unobtainable through normal means, and was intended to be used
<br>at a later point in some post-launch activity.[134] To participate in the promotion, CoroCoro readers had to send in a postcard,
<br>and from the entrants, 20 were selected at random. The winners then had to send in their cartridge for Mew to be included in
<br>their game.[134] The lottery was a success and increased word-of-mouth–by September, sales of Red and Green had surpassed 1
<br>million units.[93][134][135]</p>
